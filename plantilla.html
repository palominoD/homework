        En un <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input1" placeholder="_______"> de <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input2" placeholder="_______">,<br>
        donde <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input3" placeholder="_______"> las <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input4" placeholder="_______">,<br>
        vi <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input5" placeholder="_______"> a lo lejos<br>
        y supe que <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input6" placeholder="_______"> <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input7" placeholder="_______">.
    </p>
    <p>
        El <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input8" placeholder="_______"> <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input9" placeholder="_______"> en sus <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input10" placeholder="_______">,<br>
        mientras <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input11" placeholder="_______"> el <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input12" placeholder="_______">,<br>
        me dijo <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input13" placeholder="_______"><br>
        y sentí que <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input14" placeholder="_______"> <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input15" placeholder="_______">.

    <p>
        Something's in the-
    </P>
    <p>
        Something's in the air right now
        Like I'm <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input1" placeholder="_______"> track of time
        Like I don't really care right now, but maybe that's fine
        You <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input2" placeholder="_______"> even there that day
        I was waitin' on you
        I wondered if you aware that day was the last straw for me and I know
    </p>
    <p>
        I sent you flowers
        <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input3" placeholder="_______"> you even care?
        You ran the shower and left them by the stairs
        Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
        Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay, ay
    </p>
    <p>
        Thought you had your shit <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input4" placeholder="_______">, but damn, I was wrong
        You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
        And this <input type="text" class="dynamic-box" id="input5" placeholder="_______"> nothin' like it once was
        I know you think you're such an outlaw
        But you got no job
        You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
        And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was
        I know you think you're such an outlaw
        But you got no job
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to think you were shy
        But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
        Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
        I used to wish you were mine
        But that was way before I realized
        Someone like you would always be so easy to find
        So easy (so easy)
        He-hee, mm-mm-mm, mm
    </p>
    <p>
        Gave me no flowers
        Wish I didn't care
        You'd been gone for hours
        Could be anywhere
        Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
    </p>
    <p>
        Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
        You ain't nothing but a lost cause
        And this ain't nothing like it once was
        I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
        But you got no job
        You ain't nothing but a lost cause
        And this ain't nothing like it once was
        I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such an outlaw)
        But you got no job
    </p>
    <p>
        What did I tell you?
        Don't get complacent
        It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na
        What did I tell you?
        Don't get complacent
        It's time to face it now, na-na-na
